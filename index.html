    <section id=heading><h2>My Plans for the Future</h2></section>
    <p>In the future, I plan to either apply for college at Universiy of Texas or Texas A&M. I am going to college because it's something my parents want for me, to have a better chance at getting higher paying jobs. I don't know exactly what I job I want in the future, but I know it'll be something in technology. Although I'm not too sure about my life in the future, I know for sure that I want to get a cat.</p>
